# IonPred

Within this repository, a brief introduction to Machine Learning in Materials Science might be found. Its purpose is to present the grounds of Artificial Intelligence and its relevance in the discovery of novel crystalls, for properties ranging from photovoltaics to all-solid-state energy storage.

Please be aware that the code is under active development, bug reports are welcomed in the GitHub issues!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IonRepo/IonPred.git
cd IonPred
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution

Main codes are in .ipynb format, and all can be run independently. Note that jupyter notebook environment must be previously installed. Alternatively, they can be easly converted to .py files and run with any python compiler.
