# IonPred

Within this repository, a brief introduction to Machine Learning (ML) in materials science might be found. Its purpose is to present the grounds of Artificial Intelligence and its relevance in the discovery of novel crystalls, for properties ranging from photovoltaics to all-solid-state energy storage.

## Colab tutorial

As part of the European Kesterite Workshop, the next Colab has been developed as an introduction to ML in materials science, which can be executed online:

The data can be found in the following link:

As well, a rather quick discussion might be found in our [`introduction`](Introduction.pdf) to ML in the field, which introduces some background theory as well as innovative implementations.

Please be aware that the code and text is under active development, bug reports are welcomed in the GitHub issues!

## Installation

To download the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IonRepo/IonPred.git
cd IonPred
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution

Main codes are in .ipynb format, and all can be run independently. Note that jupyter notebook environment must be previously installed. Alternatively, they can be easly converted to .py files and run with any python compiler.
